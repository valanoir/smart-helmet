A smart helmet and a jacket for miners using various sensors and Arduino uno 


#INTRODUCTION 
Recent usage of technology is advancing but at the same time accidents is increasing rapidly. This is due to lack of proper usage of the knowledge in required places.
Helmets are the first line of defence aginst injuries.Miners face difficulties during emergency situation due to lack of communication and technology.

To overcome this we can incorpate a smart solution with miners jacket and helmet.
Smart helmet can be developed that is able to detect of hazardous events in the mines industry. In the development of helmet, we have considered the three main types of hazards such as:
Air quality,
Sos,
Collision Detection

# FUTURE ADD-ONs
We used a gps module for location tracking 
the question is is gps actually usable in underground caves?? Well the answer is no 
so instead of GPS module we change it to Lo-Ra module which is basically Long-Range this is one of the feature we would like to implement later on.
